/// This object is persistent and will be created by the GameLoader in the
/// loading room. Since it is persistent its variables will never change unless
/// you tell them too. (On a room change, the variables will not be reset since
/// the create event will only be called once during the game). Also this object
/// will not be destroyed on room changing.

// This object is perfect for keeping track of rooms visited,
// initializing properties of rooms as we progress thought our game,
// and anything else that has to do with rooms!

// Using For Game Restart And Initial Stats Setup In PlayerStatsManager
// Specify the first level of your game for game resetting or reference.
